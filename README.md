# EDA_iris
Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python
 EDA is performed  to have a better understanding of the data Always make note about different analysis or obervations you come across while exploring the data Visualization can help to better understand various statistic and information about the data. They can be used to easily convey the relevant information about the data to others. Start with simple approach and make a baseline accuracy measure that all rules and models are atleast able to achieve, then start building more complex from.

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
